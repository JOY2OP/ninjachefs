# NinjaChefs + AI

*Web application that leverages generative AI to simplify online recipe sharing.*

Sharing recipes online is tedious, often involving a lot more than just writing the recipe - such as preparing a detailed ingredient list, writing an introduction, taking an appetising picture and much more. 

NinjaChefs, with AI, attempts to eliminate this 'red tape' from online recipe sharing and faciliate the sharing of recipes by just helping the user focus on 'just the recipe'.
